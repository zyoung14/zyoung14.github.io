The Beacon is a blog dedicated to furthering the mission of the William F. Buckley, Jr. Program at Yale. It aims to challenge intellectual conformity present within the Yale community through thoughtful and thoughtÂ­-provoking reflections on campus culture, American politics, political philosophy, economics, history and more. The Beacon features commentary and scholarship from students and supporters of the Buckley Program and, occasionally, that of Bill Buckley himself.
