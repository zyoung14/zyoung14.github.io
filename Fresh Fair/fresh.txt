1. My vision is to create an online community of organic produce buyers. Each customer registers on the site, and creates a customized, weekly shopping list. This list currently includes four types of vegetables from three fictional farms. Ultimately, my vision would include a catalog of dozens of farms with a wide variety of products that customers can choose from. The customer\'92s weekly list would be delivered to their home each week at a delivery time of their choosing (pending logistics schedule.) \
\
The registration process is a key feature of the site. Currently, it just accepts an email from the customer. Ultimately, I would like to create a separate registration page where the customer lists their name, address, and payment info. We would then be able to bill the customer weekly for their deliveries, instead of requiring the customer to constantly log onto the site and order the same list again and over again. I might incorporate a \'93CostCo model\'94 in which an annual membership fees incentivizes full use of the site and discounts prices. \
\
The menu is currently under-functional. Ultimately, \'93About Us\'94 would explain 
\b Fresh Fair
\b0 \'92s mission and background in detail. \'93Our Suppliers,\'94 which currently links to a bland list of organic farms, would give brief bios about each farm and farmer. \'93Delivery Times\'94 would use the customer\'92s address to give choices for weekly delivery times. \'93Contact Us\'94 would give the customer a form to fill out complaints, job inquiries, special orders, etc. \

2. I created this site because I love quality food and supporting small, local businesses. And I don\'92t think I am the only one. Currently, the way to support nearby organic farms is to shop at neighborhood farmers\'92 markets. However, this is inefficient for both sides. Consumers have to work their schedules around the limited hours of farmers\'92 markets, which are often only open on Saturday mornings. Producers have to staff their own booths, and make payments to the market. 
\b Fresh Fair 
\b0 cuts through the inefficiencies on both sides, connecting small farms directly with consumers. By making it easier to consume healthy, organic produce, 
\b Fresh Fair 
\b0 accomplishes a social good as well. \

Given no prior experience with CSS or HTML, this project has been a great learning experience. If given the chance, I am excited to learn so much more! Thank you for your consideration. }
